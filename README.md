# Chemical Engineering Toolkit

## Author
- Jesus Torres

The **Chemical Engineering Toolkit** is a Python-based program that provides two calculators for chemical engineering tasks:

1. **Liquid Spill Volume Calculator**: Calculates the volume of a liquid spill based on user input for rectangular or circular spills.

2. **Gas Release Rate Calculator**: Estimates gas flow rates based on user input for orifice diameter, source pressure, gas temperature, and discharge coefficient.

## Features

- Calculate the volume of a liquid spill in both cubic feet and gallons.
- Estimate gas flow rates for various engineering applications.
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter.
- Calculations for common chemical engineering scenarios.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11.2
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Pillow (PIL) library for image handling (install with `pip install pillow`)
